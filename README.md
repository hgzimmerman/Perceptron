# Perceptron
A basic perceptron implementation in Rust.

Tests currently show that when trained on examples of boolean logic (1 AND 1 is 1, 0 AND 1 is 0, etc...), it will train its weights to be able to classify based on these rules.

Made in a few hours just to get a feel for basic ML principles.


## Todo
* Add some means of composing these and training the composition with backpropagation.
